# Code for Stripe Masterclass With React.js & Node.js from Udemy
## Stripe Masterclass Server Repo
(Original public code for Server)[https://github.com/cagarweyne/stripe-masterclass-server/]

## This code is upgraded for:
- Node 20.8.0
- Express ^4.18.2
- Cors ^2.8.5
- Stripe ^14.16.0

### Note for developers:
'In version numbers,
 the caret (^) symbol is often used in semantic versioning to specify a range of compatible versions.
 When you see a caret symbol before a version number, such as "^14.16.0",
 it indicates that the software should be compatible with versions equal to or greater than the specified version,
 but less than the next major release.  
 
For example, "^14.16.0" would allow installation of versions 14.16.0, 14.16.1, 14.17.0,
but would not allow version 15.0.0 or higher.
This helps ensure that you receive updates and bug fixes within the same major version while avoiding potentially breaking changes in a new major release.
